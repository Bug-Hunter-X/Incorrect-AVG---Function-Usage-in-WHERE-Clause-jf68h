This example demonstrates a common error in SQL queries involving the use of aggregate functions like AVG() within the WHERE clause.  The provided SQL attempts to filter employees based on a salary greater than the average salary, but the AVG() function cannot be directly used in this manner within a WHERE clause as it's an aggregate function operating over a dataset, not a single row.  The solution demonstrates how to correct this using a subquery.
